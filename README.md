# bot

Based on [python-mirai](https://github.com/NatriumLab/python-mirai).

# Introduction

This repository is only used for me to easier synchronize code to the server. I may not add comments to the code, so if you want to read and understand the code, it may be difficult.

This bot is designed to work in different scenarios, so the code may be confusing. I'm very sorry about this but I'm too lazy to improve it. :(

(And sorry for my poor English but if I do not write something, maybe I canâ€™t improve it forever.)

# How it works

message -> bot.py -> command.py -> pre-process -> bot.py -> choose a method -> return message
