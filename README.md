# bot

Based on [Graia](https://github.com/GraiaProject/Application).

## Introduction

This repository is only used for me to easier pull code into the server. I may not add any comments to the code(well, only `core.parser` have full code comments.), so if you want to read and understand the code, it may be difficult.

This bot is designed to work in different scenarios, the code may be confusing and quality may very poor. I'm very sorry about this but I'm too lazy to improve it. :(

(And sorry for my poor English but if I do not write something, maybe I canâ€™t change it forever.)

## How it works

message -> `bot.py` -> `core.parser(pre-process)` -> choose a method -> send message

## Where is config example?

See config branch.
